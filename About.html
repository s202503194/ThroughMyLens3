        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi!!, I am Marwa, a dreamer with a camera and a heart that catches beauty way too easily.
Photography, for me, is not just about taking pictures, it is about feeling moments, then keeping them safe so they never fade. </p>

        <h3>My Journey!</h3>
        <p>Photography has always been more than just a hobby for me, it is the language my heart speaks best. I have always been fascinated by the idea of freezing a single moment in time, capturing something so fleeting that it might never happen again, and holding onto it forever.
It all began when I was seven. I used to sneak my mum's phone whenever she wasn't looking and run outside just to take pictures of anything that caught my eye the sky, flowers, animals, random people, places I would go. Most photos were blurry, crooked, or completely random, but to me… they were magic.
When I finally got my own phone, it didn't take long before my gallery was overflowing. There were hundreds of pictures of skies that changed moods every evening, flowers that bloomed and faded, people caught mid-laughter, streets glowing after rain. Each photo told a story, even if no one else could read it.
As I grew older, photography became my escape, my therapy, and my quiet rebellion against how fast life moves. Through my lens, I learned to slow down to notice details others walked past. A year ago, I finally decided to take it seriously and bought my first digital camera, a Canon R100. The moment I held it, it felt like holding a piece of myself I didn't know was missing.
Since then, I've chased sunsets, wandered into forests, climbed rooftops, and even stood in the rain just to capture a feeling, that perfect spark that reminds me why I started. Every click feels like a heartbeat, every photo a memory I refuse to let fade.</p>

        <h3>Where I find inspiration!</h3>
        <p>Every artist has their secret place of inspiration mine is <a href="https://unsplash.com" target="_blank">Unsplash</a>.
It is one of the websites I personally use when I need a spark of creativity. I often search for the type of photography that speaks to me soft lights, nature, emotions, and raw moments and let the photos pull me into new ideas.
Unsplash is filled with free, high-quality images from photographers all around the world. Whether you are into portraits, landscapes, street shots, or moody skies, you will find something that stirs your imagination. Exploring it can help you discover what style you are drawn to, that is how many of my own photo ideas are born.</p>

        <h3>Finding the right camera!</h3>
        <p>When I decided to take my passion for photography more seriously, choosing the right camera felt overwhelming. There were so many options: DSLR, mirrorless, compact, and every article seemed to speak a different language. I wanted something simple yet powerful, something that could grow with me as I learned.
That's when I stumbled across <a href="https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/best-camera-for-beginners-best-entry-level-dslr-mirrorless-and-compact-cameras" target="_blank">Digital Camera World</a>
. Their guides made everything easier to understand. They break down camera features in a way that helps you figure out what actually matters for your style and goals. It is where I learned what to look for before I finally chose my Canon R100 and I could not be happier with it.

        <h3>Finding my tribe!</h3>
        <p>One of the most exciting parts of my photography journey has been discovering <a href="https://glass.photo" target="_blank">Glass</a>
. For me, it was not just a place to share my photos, it became a space where I found my people. Beginners like me, professionals willing to share their knowledge, and fellow dreamers who see the world through the lens in ways that inspire me every day.
On Glass, I learned to see my work differently. Every time I upload a photo, I get feedback that helps me grow, what I did well, what I can improve, and new ideas I would never thought of. It is where I connect with photographers who push me to level up, who celebrate the small victories with me, and remind me that this craft is as much about community as it is about capturing moments.
Being part of this community has changed the way I approach photography. It taught me that inspiration does not just come from places or light or cameras, it comes from people, their passion, and the shared journey we are all on together.</p>

        <h3>Where I go to capture moments!</h3>
        <p>When I first started photography, one of the hardest things was finding places that inspired me, spots that looked as magical in real life as I imagined them through my lens. That is when I discovered <a href="https://www.photohound.co/country/australia/state/victoria/photo-spots" target="_blank">PhotoHound</a>
, a website that lists photogenic locations around Victoria and (all of Australia).
I started using it to plan my little photography adventures, exploring hidden corners, scenic streets, parks, and nature spots I never would have found on my own. Some of my favorite shots came from these trips — it taught me to see beauty in unexpected places, experiment with angles, and keep challenging myself.
If you are looking for ideas or want to practice in real locations, this site is a goldmine for photographers, whether you are just starting out or trying to expand your portfolio. </p>
